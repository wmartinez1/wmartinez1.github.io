				<h2>Favorite Things</h2>
				<p style="font-size:28px">
					What i like to do is usually play video games and go out with friends to do stuff and hang out. The video games i play is Valorent, Call Of Duty, NBA 2K20. I'm more into PC games than console games, but i play more console because my friends all have console rather than PC. riding bikes and BIRD scooters they are so much fun, i also like the night time because everything is so calm(depending where you are) and its just a vibe.
